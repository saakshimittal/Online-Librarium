# Online-Librarium
A digital library, digital repository, or digital collection, is an online database of digital objects
that can include text, still images, audio, video, digital documents, or other digital media formats.
Objects can consist of digitized content like print or photographs, as well as originally produced
digital content like word processor files or social media posts. In addition to storing content,
digital libraries provide means for organizing, searching, and retrieving the content contained in
the collection.
On libraries can vary immensely in size and scope, and can be maintained by individuals or
organizations. The digital content may be stored locally, or accessed remotely via computer
networks. These information retrieval systems are able to exchange information with each other
through interoperability and sustainability.
An online Librarium has numerous advantages, specially, during the current scenario of this
pandemic. Since Physical access to Libraries have been restricted there is a need rising to provide
access to the books to Students. This concept of an online librarium is developed to cater the needs
of the students by providing them with books online. Students would be issued books of all types
in the time frame given. Users/Students have to register and make an account. They have to login
using their username and password. The book searched on the basis of the category chosen would
be shown and can be downloaded by the user. Additionally there is a feature/section “Contact Us”
for the user to write their queries which is then answered by the admin.
Admin Account on the other hand can only be accessed by the admin using another set of username
and password set by the admin itself. That account is used to delete/add set of books, see and reply
to the queries raised by the students using the “Contact us” option made available to Students.
